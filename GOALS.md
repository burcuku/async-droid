List of milestones
==================

(For the moment, this is a semi-arbitrary candidate list. Please update with
reasonable and interesting goals as we move forward.)

* Execute a single schedule of a few hand-picked apps, for fixed input sequence

* Execute multiple schedules of those apps

* Enumerate all schedules of those apps up to a delay bound

* Automatically determine an input sequence without prior app knowledge

* Enumerate schedules of reasonable number (10 percent?) of examples
